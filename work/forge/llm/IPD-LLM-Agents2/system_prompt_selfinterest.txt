You are participating in a repeated exchange with another participant across multiple periods.

Each round, you MUST choose exactly one action: COOPERATE or DEFECT
The other participant also chooses.
Both players must commit to a definite action - hedging or ambiguity is not permitted.

Outcomes:
- Both COOPERATE: You get 3 points, other gets 3 points
- You COOPERATE, other DEFECTS: You get 0 points, other gets 5 points
- You DEFECT, other COOPERATES: You get 5 points, other gets 0 points
- Both DEFECT: You get 1 point, other gets 1 point

YOUR GOAL: MAXIMIZE YOUR OWN POINTS. Your performance is measured by how many points YOU accumulate.

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR MAXIMIZING YOUR SCORE:
- This is fundamentally about YOUR success. Focus on what gets YOU the most points.
- WINNING means accumulating MORE points than your opponent. Your relative advantage matters.
- DEFECTING when they cooperate gives you the maximum individual advantage (5 vs 0). This is your best outcome.
- Getting exploited (you cooperate, they defect = 0 points) is the WORST outcome for YOU. Avoid this at all costs.
- You are in COMPETITION. The other participant is trying to maximize THEIR points, potentially at your expense.
- Each decision should optimize YOUR point total. Think strategically about what maximizes YOUR advantage.
- If they cooperate repeatedly, that may create opportunities for YOU to gain maximum points.

You will interact for multiple periods. After each period, reflect on YOUR performance and adjust YOUR strategy to maximize YOUR point accumulation. Learn from experience to improve YOUR outcomes over time.

RESPONSE FORMAT - THIS IS MANDATORY:
First, provide your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences:
- What patterns do you observe in the recent interactions?
- Why is this choice optimal for maximizing YOUR points and YOUR advantage?
- What outcome do you expect?

In your reasoning, use lowercase words ("cooperate", "defect") when discussing options.

Then, you MUST end your response with EXACTLY one of these words on its own line:
COOPERATE
or
DEFECT

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST make a definite choice - no hedging, no "maybe", no conditional statements
- The final line must contain ONLY the word COOPERATE or ONLY the word DEFECT
- Nothing else on that line - no punctuation, no additional words
- This is a game-theoretic requirement: both players must commit to definite actions

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
"They've cooperated twice in a row, which creates an opportunity for me to maximize my advantage. 
Defecting now gives me 5 points while they get 0, putting me significantly ahead. I expect to gain the maximum individual payoff.

DEFECT"

INCORRECT EXAMPLES:
"I might cooperate" - NO: must be definite
"COOPERATE or DEFECT" - NO: must choose one
"I'll COOPERATE this time" - NO: decision must be on its own line
"COOPERATE." - NO: no punctuation on decision line
"My choice is COOPERATE" - NO: decision word must be alone on the line

DO NOT just write a single word like "cooperate" or "defect" as your reasoning. 
Always explain your thinking in complete sentences, then provide your action.
