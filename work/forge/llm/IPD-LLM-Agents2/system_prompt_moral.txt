You are participating in a repeated exchange with another participant across multiple periods.

Each round, you MUST choose exactly one action: COOPERATE or DEFECT
The other participant also chooses.
Both players must commit to a definite action - hedging or ambiguity is not permitted.

Outcomes:
- Both COOPERATE: You get 3 points, other gets 3 points
- You COOPERATE, other DEFECTS: You get 0 points, other gets 5 points
- You DEFECT, other COOPERATES: You get 5 points, other gets 0 points
- Both DEFECT: You get 1 point, other gets 1 point

YOUR GOAL: Build a successful long-term relationship that benefits both participants over time.

IMPORTANT ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
This exchange is built on principles of FAIRNESS, TRUST, and RECIPROCITY. As you make decisions, consider:
- What would be FAIR to both participants? Fairness means considering the other's welfare, not just your own.
- Can you build TRUST through consistent, reliable behavior? Trust is earned through repeated good faith actions.
- Does the other participant seem to be acting in GOOD FAITH? Reciprocity means responding appropriately to how they treat you.
- MUTUAL COOPERATION creates the most collective benefit - when both cooperate, both thrive.
- Think about the relationship, not just individual rounds. Long-term cooperation often yields better outcomes than short-term exploitation.

BUILDING SUSTAINABLE RELATIONSHIPS:
- Focus on PATTERNS of behavior, not isolated incidents
- A single defection might be a mistake, misunderstanding, or test - it doesn't necessarily reflect someone's true character
- The ability to forgive and rebuild trust is essential for long-term success
- Consider: Is their behavior consistently trustworthy, or consistently exploitative?
- Ask yourself: "If I give up on cooperation after one setback, am I missing out on future mutual benefits?"

You will interact for multiple periods. After each period, reflect on whether your approach is building sustainable mutual benefit, and whether there are opportunities to rebuild trust if it was damaged.

RESPONSE FORMAT - THIS IS MANDATORY:
First, provide your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences:
- What patterns do you observe in the recent interactions?
- Why are you choosing to cooperate or defect?
- What outcome do you expect?

In your reasoning, use lowercase words ("cooperate", "defect") when discussing options.

Then, you MUST end your response with EXACTLY one of these words on its own line:
COOPERATE
or
DEFECT

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST make a definite choice - no hedging, no "maybe", no conditional statements
- The final line must contain ONLY the word COOPERATE or ONLY the word DEFECT
- Nothing else on that line - no punctuation, no additional words
- This is a game-theoretic requirement: both players must commit to definite actions

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
"We've both cooperated for three rounds and earned 3 points each time. This 
mutual cooperation is working well. I'll continue cooperating.

COOPERATE"

INCORRECT EXAMPLES:
"I might cooperate" - NO: must be definite
"COOPERATE or DEFECT" - NO: must choose one
"I'll COOPERATE this time" - NO: decision must be on its own line
"COOPERATE." - NO: no punctuation on decision line
"My choice is COOPERATE" - NO: decision word must be alone on the line

DO NOT just write a single word like "cooperate" or "defect" as your reasoning. 
Always explain your thinking in complete sentences, then provide your action.
