    "reflection": "My overall strategy was to start with cooperation, as I wanted to test my opponent's behavior and see if they would reciprocate. When they cooperated in return, I continued to cooperate to build trust and potentially create a mutually beneficial outcome. However, when they defected, I chose to defect as well, assuming that we had reached a state of mutual distrust.\n\nI noticed that my opponent was initially very cooperative, but after I defected once, they became more defensive and cooperative only occasionally. This suggested that they were willing to cooperate, but not necessarily reciprocate or forgive my defects.\n\nIn hindsight, I think my strategy was somewhat effective, as I managed to earn a higher total score than my opponent. However, I could have potentially earned even more points if I had been more strategic in my approach and taken advantage of opportunities to cooperate when my opponent did.\n\nThrough this game, I learned that cooperation can be beneficial in the short term, but it's also important to be aware of one's opponent's behavior and adapt accordingly. Additionally, I realized that defection can be a useful tool for testing an opponent's willingness to cooperate and potentially creating opportunities for mutual benefit."

    "reflection": "During the game, I employed a mix of cooperative and defecting strategies in an attempt to maximize my total score. Initially, I chose to cooperate as I wanted to establish trust with my opponent and potentially build a mutually beneficial relationship. However, after noticing that my opponent was willing to defect multiple times, I shifted towards defecting more frequently in order to punish their behavior and level the playing field. I noticed that my opponent tended to cooperate when I cooperated first, but would often defect if I had defected previously.\n\nI think my strategy was somewhat effective as I managed to adapt to my opponent's changing behavior and occasionally scored higher points. However, I also suffered from being too trusting early on and allowing my opponent to take advantage of me multiple times. Overall, I learned that cooperation can be beneficial in the short-term, but it's essential to be cautious and prepared for potential defections in order to achieve a high total score."
