    "reflection": "Overall, my strategy was to defect consistently throughout the game, as I noticed that my opponent was also defecting most of the time. I didn't see any patterns in their behavior that would suggest they were willing to cooperate, and therefore I didn't want to risk losing points by cooperating myself. I chose to defect because it seemed like the safest option given my opponent's behavior, but this ultimately meant that we both ended up with lower scores than if we had cooperated occasionally. Looking back, I can see that my strategy was not effective in terms of maximizing our total points, as cooperation could have led to higher scores for both of us. However, in the context of the game, it seemed like a reasonable choice given the information I had at the time."

    "reflection": "Throughout the game, I employed a defecting strategy as my opponent consistently defected in every round, demonstrating a lack of cooperation. I chose to defect in response to their defects, as it seemed the most effective way to maximize my points and minimize potential losses. Upon reflection, I noticed that my opponent never cooperated once throughout the entire game, indicating a strong tendency towards selfish behavior. In hindsight, I believe my strategy was somewhat effective in securing 19 points, but ultimately fell short compared to my opponent's score of 24 points. This experience has taught me that cooperation can be a crucial factor in achieving higher total points, and that adopting a more cooperative approach might have led to better outcomes in this game."
