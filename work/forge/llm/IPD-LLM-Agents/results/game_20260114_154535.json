I chose to cooperate 21 out of 25 rounds because it allowed me to build a strong foundation of cooperation and increase the chances of achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. As for patterns in my opponent's behavior, I didn't notice any significant changes or inconsistencies that would have led me to adjust my strategy.\n\nI believe my strategy was effective in achieving a tie with my opponent, as we both ended up with 69 points. Cooperating allowed us to maintain a consistent level of mutual trust and cooperation, which ultimately led to our shared success."

    "reflection": "Throughout the game, I employed a cooperative strategy to maintain a high level of mutual cooperation with my opponent. I chose to cooperate in 21 out of 25 rounds because I wanted to create an environment where both parties could benefit from working together and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. As I observed my opponent's consistent cooperation, I noticed that they were committed to maintaining the cooperative relationship as well.\n\nI believe my strategy was effective in achieving a tie with my opponent, as we both ended up with 69 points. By cooperating, I was able to avoid the risks associated with defecting and potentially losing points. Additionally, my cooperative approach allowed me to build trust with my opponent, which may have led them to reciprocate with cooperation.\n\nThrough this game, I learned that in situations where mutual benefit is possible, cooperation can be a highly effective strategy for achieving success."
