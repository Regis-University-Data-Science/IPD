    "reflection": "My overall strategy was to start with cooperation, hoping to establish a cooperative relationship and potentially achieve higher scores together. However, as my opponent didn't reciprocate, I switched to defecting to maximize my score. I noticed that my opponent cooperated more frequently than me, but they also defected when I did, suggesting a willingness to retaliate. My strategy was effective in the sense that I maximized my total points, but it was also somewhat exploitative as I took advantage of my opponent's initial cooperation. Looking back, I learned that while cooperation can lead to higher scores, defecting can be an effective way to maximize points when the other player is not cooperative."

    "reflection": "In retrospect, my overall strategy was to start with cooperation, hoping to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with my opponent. When they defected in Round 5, I switched to defecting as well, trying to maintain a balance and prevent further exploitation. As the game progressed, I noticed that my opponent continued to defect, even after I had tried cooperating multiple times. This led me to conclude that they were not interested in cooperation and might be playing a more strategic game. Despite this, I stuck with defecting as it seemed to be the most effective way to get a decent payoff. In hindsight, I think my strategy was somewhat effective, but I could have done better by adapting to my opponent's behavior earlier on.\n\nI learned that in the Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperation is often not enough to guarantee a good outcome, especially when dealing with an opponent who is more strategic and willing to defect. The game highlights the importance of adaptability and being prepared for different scenarios, as well as the need to weigh the potential benefits of cooperation against the risks of exploitation."
