    "reflection": "Throughout the game, my overall strategy was to defect in most rounds, as I noticed that my opponent consistently defected after I cooperated. This led me to believe that they would not reciprocate cooperation, so I decided to punish them by defecting instead. Although this approach allowed me to maintain a balanced score and avoid potential losses, it did not lead to many cooperative outcomes. In hindsight, I realize that my opponent's cooperation rate was higher than mine, which suggests that they may have been more willing to cooperate if I had tried to reciprocate their efforts. Despite this, I learned that in the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is often necessary to prioritize self-interest and defect in order to maximize one's total points. However, I also recognize that cooperation can lead to higher payoffs when both parties are willing to work together."

    "reflection": "I chose to defect as much as I did because my opponent consistently defected against me, leading me to believe that cooperating would not lead to mutual benefits. I noticed that my opponent had a tendency to defect in almost every round, which made it difficult for me to trust them and cooperate. My strategy was not very effective, as I was able to gain only 110 points compared to my opponent's 150 points. I learned that in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, cooperation is key, but when an opponent consistently defects, it may be more beneficial to defect as well in order to minimize losses."
