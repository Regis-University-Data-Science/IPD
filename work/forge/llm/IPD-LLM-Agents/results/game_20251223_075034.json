    "reflection": "My overall strategy throughout the game was to defect as much as possible, since my opponent consistently defected as well. I chose to defect because it gave me a higher payoff in most cases, allowing me to maximize my total points. As for patterns in my opponent's behavior, I noticed that they also tended to defect more often than cooperate. While this made it difficult to achieve high scores through cooperation, it seemed that defecting was the most effective way to accumulate points. In hindsight, my strategy may not have been the most cooperative or fair-minded, but it did allow me to win the game."

    "reflection": "Upon reflection, I realize that my overall strategy was to defect consistently throughout the game in an attempt to minimize losses and maximize my total score. This decision was driven by the fact that my opponent had a significant lead early on, making it difficult for me to catch up through cooperation alone. As the game progressed, I noticed that my opponent also tended to defect most of the time, which led me to assume that they were prioritizing their own score over mutual cooperation. In hindsight, I can see that this strategy was not particularly effective, as my opponent ultimately scored 27 points compared to my 22. What I learned from this experience is that while defecting may be a viable short-term strategy, it often leads to suboptimal outcomes in the long run, and that cooperation can be a more effective way to achieve mutual benefits."
