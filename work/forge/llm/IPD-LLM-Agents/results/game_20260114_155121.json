    "reflection": "Throughout the game, my overall strategy was to defect as much as possible in order to maximize my score. I chose to do this because I realized that since I wasn't going to catch up, it would be better for me to focus on getting as many points as possible rather than trying to cooperate and risk losing more points. As for patterns in my opponent's behavior, I noticed that they tended to defect most of the time, which led me to conclude that they were also playing a similar strategy.\n\nI think my strategy was somewhat effective in terms of maximizing my score, but it wasn't very cooperative or fair play. In hindsight, I could have tried to cooperate more and potentially gained some points back from my opponent. However, since I didn't know what their strategy would be, I played it safe by defecting most of the time.\n\nOne thing I learned is that in a Prisoner's Dilemma game, it can be tempting to focus on individual gain rather than cooperation. While this might lead to a higher score in the short term, it ultimately doesn't promote trust or mutual benefit between players."

    "reflection": "My overall strategy throughout the game was to defect as much as possible, aiming to maximize my score by exploiting the opponent's cooperations. I noticed that my opponent consistently cooperated with me after I had defected in previous rounds, which led me to believe they were following a tit-for-tat strategy. Given this pattern, I continued to defect, as it seemed to be the most effective way to accumulate points. While my strategy was successful in terms of total score, I did notice that the opponent's cooperation rate was higher than mine, indicating that I could have potentially gained more points by cooperating occasionally. In hindsight, I realize that a mixed strategy might have been more effective, as it would have allowed me to take advantage of the opponent's cooperations while also maintaining a level of reciprocity."
