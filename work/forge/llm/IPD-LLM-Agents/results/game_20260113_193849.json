I noticed that my opponent also defected consistently, and we were stuck in a stalemate. My strategy seemed effective in terms of maximizing my points, but it was not very cooperative or mutually beneficial. In hindsight, I think a more cooperative approach might have led to higher total scores for both parties."

    "reflection": "Throughout the game, my overall strategy was to defect as much as possible, sticking to this approach for 20 out of 25 rounds. I chose to defect because it seemed like the most effective way to maximize my score, given that my opponent was also defecting in most rounds. I noticed that my opponent's behavior was consistent with mine, exhibiting a pattern of mutual defection. While my strategy did result in a tied score at the end, I don't think it was particularly effective in terms of fostering cooperation or building trust. Instead, it reinforced the prisoner's dilemma, where both parties prioritize their own interests over mutual gain."
