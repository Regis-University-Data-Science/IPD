    "reflection": "My overall strategy was to start by defecting frequently, as I wanted to take advantage of the opponent's initial lack of information about my behavior. As the game progressed, I noticed that the opponent consistently defected after every other round, which made it clear that they were playing a tit-for-tat strategy. In response, I started cooperating more often in an attempt to build trust and increase our mutual cooperation rate. However, this did not lead to significant changes in my opponent's behavior, as they continued to defect most of the time. Looking back, I realize that my strategy was not effective in achieving a high total score, but it did allow me to gain some points through occasional cooperation. Overall, I learned that cooperation can be beneficial in the short term, but in a prisoner's dilemma game like this, defection is often the most effective strategy for maximizing one's own score."

    "reflection": "In this game, I employed a primarily defecting strategy, as I aimed to maximize my total score by exploiting my opponent's occasional cooperative moves. I noticed that my opponent cooperated around 48% of the time, but since it was often met with my defecting responses, I didn't see any significant benefits in cooperating myself. My strategy was effective in securing a high total score, but it may not have been the most optimal approach considering the opponent's behavior. I learned that while cooperation can lead to higher scores in specific situations, a primarily defecting strategy can still be successful when facing an opponent with a similar mindset."
