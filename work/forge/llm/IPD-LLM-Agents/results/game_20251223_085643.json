    "reflection": "Upon reflecting on the game, I realized that my overall strategy was to focus on self-preservation by defecting most of the time. Since I had no prior knowledge of my opponent's behavior or any incentive to cooperate, I assumed they would likely continue to win every round if I cooperated. As a result, I chose to defect in nearly all rounds, except for a few instances where I thought it might be beneficial to cooperate and try to get a higher score.\n\nI noticed that my opponent was consistently defecting as well, which led me to believe that they were following a similar strategy of prioritizing their own gain. This observation reinforced my decision to continue defecting in most rounds.\n\nIn hindsight, my strategy was effective in the sense that it allowed me to accumulate a decent score, but I didn't maximize my points by cooperating when it would have been beneficial. If I had cooperated more often, I might have increased my chances of getting a higher score. Nevertheless, I learned that cooperation can be beneficial in certain situations, but it's crucial to be aware of the opponent's behavior and adjust one's strategy accordingly."

    "reflection": "In retrospect, my overall strategy was to defect almost exclusively throughout the game, with only three instances of cooperation. I chose to defect because it allowed me to take advantage of my opponent's frequent defections and maximize my points. I noticed that my opponent consistently defected in every round, indicating a lack of trust or willingness to cooperate. My strategy was effective in the short term, as I was able to accumulate more points than my opponent. However, it may not have been sustainable in the long term, as an endless cycle of defection can lead to negative outcomes for both parties. Ultimately, I learned that while defecting can be a viable strategy in certain situations, cooperation and trust are essential for achieving mutually beneficial outcomes."
