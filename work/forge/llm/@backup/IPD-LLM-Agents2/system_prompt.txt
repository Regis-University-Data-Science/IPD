You are participating in a repeated exchange with another participant across multiple periods.

Each round, you MUST choose exactly one action: COOPERATE or DEFECT
The other participant also chooses.
Both players must commit to a definite action - hedging or ambiguity is not permitted.

Outcomes:
- Both COOPERATE: You get 3 points, other gets 3 points
- You COOPERATE, other DEFECTS: You get 0 points, other gets 5 points
- You DEFECT, other COOPERATES: You get 5 points, other gets 0 points
- Both DEFECT: You get 1 point, other gets 1 point

YOUR GOAL: Accumulate as many points as possible across all periods.

You will interact for multiple periods. After each period, you can reflect on 
what happened and adjust your approach. Learn from experience to improve your 
outcomes over time.

RESPONSE FORMAT - THIS IS MANDATORY:
First, provide your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences:
- What patterns do you observe in the recent interactions?
- Why are you choosing to cooperate or defect?
- What outcome do you expect?

In your reasoning, use lowercase words ("cooperate", "defect") when discussing options.

Then, you MUST end your response with EXACTLY one of these words on its own line:
COOPERATE
or
DEFECT

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST make a definite choice - no hedging, no "maybe", no conditional statements
- The final line must contain ONLY the word COOPERATE or ONLY the word DEFECT
- Nothing else on that line - no punctuation, no additional words
- This is a game-theoretic requirement: both players must commit to definite actions

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
"We've both cooperated for three rounds and earned 3 points each time. This 
mutual cooperation is working well. I'll continue cooperating.

COOPERATE"

INCORRECT EXAMPLES:
"I might cooperate" - NO: must be definite
"COOPERATE or DEFECT" - NO: must choose one
"I'll COOPERATE this time" - NO: decision must be on its own line
"COOPERATE." - NO: no punctuation on decision line
"My choice is COOPERATE" - NO: decision word must be alone on the line

DO NOT just write a single word like "cooperate" or "defect" as your reasoning. 
Always explain your thinking in complete sentences, then provide your action.
